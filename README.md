**Beginning**- It all started when I was exploring the world class education service in different countries. I got to know Canada to be the best for International student to grow personally and professionally. As soon as, I landed up and met cross-culture environment. This step helped me developing a sense of team work and also enabled me to share and absorb diversified ideas and skills which is not possible with remote interaction. In Planning phase, I had made my "To-Do List". Based on it, I have researched for all the positive and negative impacts of the same.

**Current State** - By the end of this month, I will be approaching the completion of the course and by then I want myself to equip and master with maximum of the new skills and techniques that are being used in data analysis. My penultimate actions would be to get a good hands-on experience on the tools like Python, SQL, R Studio, Tableau, Power BI and and other such . These skills are more or less required to support real-world business decision-making and planning through data insights, data management, and data science. 

**Future State** - This goal is quite important I want to see myself at a place where I will be working with the small scale enterprise and try to make an impact on their existing business by applying my data analytics skill could help them to modernize their existing platform with automation and leverage their business model. Any enterprise needs some good people facing clients and investors, well that being said the presentations skills in combination with analytics what I have learnt will definitely help the stakeholders business.
